                This interactive baseball quiz has hundreds of questions (and growing) on the rules of baseball.
                It's meant for everybody who wants to practice their knowledge of the rules, like umpires,
                players and coaches.
              </p>
              <p>
                The quiz is inspired by https://quiz.thetasoft.com/ and built as an educational project by two trainees
                from the Dutch Tax Service, together with two experienced Dutch umpires who work for the Dutch Baseball
                Association KNBSB.
              </p>
              <p>
                The questions are based on the most recent OBR rules, generic for every country in the world.
              </p>
